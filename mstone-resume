\sect{Recent Employment}{
  \job{2013-2014}{Senior Architect, \rm Information Security}{Akamai Technologies}
    \mh Today, I manage Akamai's ``Safety Team'', which oversees and
    administers Akamai's company-wide technical incident management process.
    Together with three reports, one peer, and several senior colleagues, I
    review tens of incidents per year, train hundreds of incident responders,
    answer senior management's incident-related questions, and personally help
    support, coordinate, \& direct response efforts for internet-wide security
    crises as needed. To date, multiple of my lifetime staff have been or are up
    for promotion.

  \job{2011-2012}{Architect, \rm Information Security}{Akamai Technologies}
    \mh While continuing to provide product security architecture Advice \&
    Review, I joined Akamai's 24x7x365 incident management on-call rotation,
    the members of which are expected to be able to manage {\jtf any} emerging
    technical problem until other help arrives. Earlier, I also prototyped
    several information retrieval systems for distributed log search,
    suspicious JavaScript detection, and code search running in Python, C++,
    and Haskell, in some cases on thousands of machines and petabytes of data,
    and became a people-manager, thereby hiring and developing several security researchers.

  \job{mid 2009-2010}{Senior Researcher, \rm Information Security}{Akamai Technologies}
    \mh As a new hire, I polished and turned the crank on Akamai's security architecture ``Advice
    \& Review'' technical oversight process, gained early experience
    communicating results to senior management, built tools, advised incident
    managers as a subject-matter expert in information security, and, by happy
    accident, discovered and introduced Dr.\ Nancy Leveson's {\jdf STAMP}
    model of accident causation and system safety to Akamai.

  \job{March 2008-Jan 2009}{Release Manager}{One Laptop per Child}
    \mh In 34 weeks, I defined a new release process and, in concert with
    representatives from ProdM, QA, Eng, and Biz, guided a distributed team of
    employees, contractors, and community members which integrated changes
    that closed approximately 1,000 tickets, including a complete UI redesign.
    The release shipped within 6 weeks of the target month, with only two
    serious regressions, to positive reviews on Amazon and in the OLPC
    software community at large.

  \job{June 2007-March 2008}{Software Developer}{One Laptop per Child}
    \mh I delivered portions of OLPC's ``Bitfrost'' security system including
    its activity isolation framework, parts of its software theft deterrence
    system, and its secure update system. This work addressed the technical
    problem of safeguarding the education of hundreds of thousands of children
    and the commercial problem of convincing several governments to purchase
    Linux-based educational laptops from an untested startup.
