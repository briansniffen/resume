# resume

This is my resume in LaTeX.  For a couple years I used a plain TeX resume format inspired by the inimitable Michael Stone (@mstone).  But to make this parallel-job thing work, I'm experimenting with porting it forward to LaTeX.

Look at bsniffen-cso.pdf for the current version, bsniffen.pdf for what I used in 2016.
