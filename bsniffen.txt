## Objective

  My next job search will be guided by good problems and a good set of
  peers to learn from. I expect them to be problems labeled "CSO,"
  "(business unit) CTO" or similar, and to be looking to learn from a
  CEO's senior advisors.

## Recent Employment

Chief Architect & Senior Director,
Information Security,
Akamai Technologies
2008-2016
    Hired to implement "Plan B," a vision of a research-based backstop
    to a traditional network-admin security team.  By 2010, delivered
    results sufficient to replace the traditional team with an applied
    research team. We've hired for a long-term view and (typically) a
    background outside IT security-- emphasizing fields with a strong
    Safety Engineering culture (Chem. Eng., Aero-Astro), or an
    adversarial focus (e.g., veterans). In 2016, that team is
    responsible for:

  - Safety: Set Akamai's incident response, train orst responders, and
    engage directly with crises. We did the work in 2012 and 2013 that
    let Akamai survive 2014 (Heartbleed, Shellshock, etc.) without
    trauma.
  - Cryptography: Centralized crypto and specialized security
    engineering, leading re-investment in cryptographic excellence
    after a period of benign neglect.
  - Debt Reduction: Technical leadership of the "severe vulnerability"
    process, a board-supervised, CEO- managed investment in serious
    technical debts across the company. Twelve of the top twenty
    actionable debts are mitigated or better, since 2013.
  - Product & Platform Architecture: security architecture team
    reviewing new products, including bring- ing that team from CMM1
    work coordination by e-mails and a chat system to CMM3 publication
    of professional reviews that have become the go-to resource for a
    technical overview across the company.
  - Compliance: Healing a broken and burned out team. Company myth
    says we had push-button ISO 17799 assessments in 2006, but this
    had rotted by 2010. After two years of intense training,
    motivation, and re-organization, we have mature processes for
    assessments against PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITRUST, ISO 27002,
    Sarbanes-Oxley, and FedRAMP. SOC2 is underway.
