\sect{Recent Employment}
\job{2008--}{Fellow}{Akamai Technologies}
Apply technical expertise to advance the mission of the company.  In
practice, this means two jobs: one as an individual contributor like
the other Akamai Fellows, one supervising a group that peers to
Engineering and Product departments run by \textsc{vp}s.  Let's break those out:

\noindent \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
  \job{}{Chief Security Architect}{Akamai}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Expertise: Both directly and by fostering growth in
      technical depth in others, \emph{be a font of technical
        expertise}.  Be a trusted advisor for Akamai's executives.
    \item Influence: Persuade Engineering and Product \textsc{vp}s to
      prioritize security improvements and paydown on technical debt.
      Use the boundaries of the incident \& \textsc{esv} processes
    \item Oracle: See the future of tech and techncial businesses that
      will affect Akamai, and change that future as appropriate.
      Engage with standards bodies, build relationships with peers
      across industry and academy, and inform execs of coming risks.
    \item Safety: Set Akamai's incident response, train first responders,
      and engage directly with crises.  Answer the phone when the
      \textsc{fbi} needs help in minutes.  Also incident exec, handle
      \textsc{nsl}s and \textsc{ecpa} orders, and supervise a process that
      annually produces a first-class problem.
    \item Cryptography: Centralized crypto and specialized security
      engineering, leading re-investment in cryptographic excellence after a
      period of benign neglect.
  \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
  \job{}{Vice President, \rm System Safety \& Resilience}{Akamai}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Debt Reduction: Technical leadership of the ``severe
vulnerability'' process, a board-supervised, \textsc{ceo}-managed investment in
serious technical debts across the company.  Twelve of the top twenty
actionable debts are mitigated or better, since 2013.
\item Product \& Platform Architecture:  security architecture team
reviewing new products, including bringing that team from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model}{\textsc{cmm}1} work
coordination by e-mails and a chat system to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model}{\textsc{cmm}3} publication of
professional reviews that have become the go-to resource for a
technical overview across the company.  Now 80\% through a transition
to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model}{\textsc{cmm}4}
``EZPath'' system that brings review \& analysis capability into
product groups.
\item Compliance: Healed a broken and burned out team.  Company myth
says we had push-button \textsc{iso} 17799 assessments in 2006, but this had
rotted by 2010.  After two years of intense training, motivation, and
re-organization, we had mature processes for assessments against
\textsc{pci-dss, hipaa/hitrust, iso 27002}, Sarbanes-Oxley, and Fed\textsc{ramp}.  Hired
new Director of Compliance, brought him to speed, promoted him to a peer, and
spun off the Compliance team.
\item Management: Blew the curves for employee retention, development
  of talent, and recruitment of non-
  \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\job{2003--2008}{Lead Researcher, \rm Secure Technology
  Solutions}{MITRE Corporation}
%\mh
Designed and implemented a variety of security
  tools and programs for government sponsors, managed teams of up to
  10 people on tasks of up to 4 full-time equivalents. Coordinated
  with remote contributors and sponsors while anticipating sponsor's
  future and inarticulable needs.  Principal technical reference for
  trusted computing technology (TPMs).  Typical projects were briefed to \textsc{ic} \textsc{gs-15}s.
